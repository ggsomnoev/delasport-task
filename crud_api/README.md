## Frontend

The frontend for this project is located in the `delasport-task-main` directory. Please refer to the README file for more info.

## Future Improvements

1. Using **NestJS** could be the better option here (out-of-the-box clear structure, ease of writing tests, and many more benefits).
2. Having tests is really important. It would have been great to have added unit tests, integration tests, e2e tests, performance tests, etc.
3. Having **Redis** also for caching will be benefitial.
4. Better code quality â€“ linter/TypeScript errors, config parameters, etc.
